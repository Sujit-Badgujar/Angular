- **Learn:**
  - Template-driven vs. reactive forms.
  - Use RxJS for reactive programming.

**Hands-On:**
- Create a user registration form with validation.
- Build a shopping cart using a shared service for state management.

---

#### **Week 7: Angular Material and UI Components**

### **Phase 3: Building Real-World Projects (Weeks 9–12)**

**Objective:** Develop portfolio projects showcasing full-stack capabilities.

#### **Project 1: E-Commerce Dashboard**
- Features:
  - Product listing with search and filters.
  - User login and registration (JWT-based).
  - Cart and checkout process.
- Tools: Angular Material for design, .NET Core for backend.

#### **Project 2: Task Tracker with Reporting**
- Features:
  - Add, update, delete tasks.
  - Generate reports (e.g., completed tasks by date).
  - Deploy to Azure App Service for hands-on hosting experience.

---

### **Phase 4: Job Preparation (Weeks 13–14)**

**Objective:** Prepare for interviews and apply for full-stack roles.

#### **Week 13: Polish and Portfolio**
- Host your projects on GitHub or Azure.
- Document each project with a detailed README.
- Build a portfolio showcasing:
  - Angular front-end expertise.
  - Full-stack applications with .NET backend.

#### **Week 14: Mock Interviews and Applications**
